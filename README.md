# Open Niagara - To be renamed to another waterfall
Why? See: [https://github.com/NiagaraLauncher/Niagara-Issues/issues/180](https://github.com/NiagaraLauncher/Niagara-Issues/issues/180)

The waterfall bar that niagara has is too tempting of a feature to give up lol, so that's where we are going to start

# Checklist in order of importance
- [ ] get the watefall app bar down
- [ ] basic launcher features
- [ ] notifications on app names
- [ ] home screen
- [ ] see if ts shit is worth it
