# Open Niagara - To be renamed to another waterfall
Why? See: [https://github.com/NiagaraLauncher/Niagara-Issues/issues/180](https://github.com/NiagaraLauncher/Niagara-Issues/issues/180), [https://github.com/NiagaraLauncher/Niagara-Issues/issues/1680](https://github.com/NiagaraLauncher/Niagara-Issues/issues/1680)

The waterfall bar that niagara has is too tempting of a feature to give up lol, so that's where we are going to start

# Demo (from `stupid` branch [here](https://github.com/theSoberSobber/Open-Niagara/tree/stupid))
